# Thomas Niebler's GitHub page

Hi, I'm Thomas, welcome to my GitHub page :) I am a PhD student at the @dmirgroup in Wuerzburg, Germany. My interests lie in text understanding, specifically methods to calculate semantic relatedness between words. I'm also interested in machine learning and methods to integrate both.

## Repositories
* [Supplementary materials for "Learning Semantic Relatedness from Human Feedback using Metric Learning"](http://thomasniebler.github.io/semantics-metriclearning)
* Other repositories are soon incoming

## Publications
My publications can be found over at [BibSononmy](https://www.bibsonomy.org/user/thoni/myown). I publish code on here for some of them.
