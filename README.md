# Thomas Niebler's GitHub page

Hi, I'm Thomas, welcome to my GitHub page :) I am a PhD student at the @dmirgroup in Wuerzburg, Germany. My interests lie in text understanding, specifically methods to calculate semantic relatedness between words. I'm also interested in machine learning and methods to integrate both.

## Repositories
* [Supplementary materials for "Learning Semantic Relatedness from Human Feedback using Metric Learning"](http://thomasniebler.github.io/semantics-metriclearning)
* [Supplementary materials for "Learning Word Embeddings from Tagging Data: A methodological comparison"](https://thomasniebler.github.io/semantics-tagembeddings)
* [Tools to construct co-occurrence based page vectors from navigational paths](https://thomasniebler.github.io/semantics-pathtools).<br />
This repository contains the methodologies proposed in "Computing Semantic Relatedness from Human Navigation:
A Case Study on Wikipedia" and “Extracting Semantic Relatedness from Unconstrained Navigation on Wikipedia”
* [Strava Club Challenges](https://github.com/thomasniebler/strava-clubchallenges): I fiddled around with the API of Strava
to create a small Django webapp where Strava members can pose challenges restricted to their clubs.

## Publications
My publications can be found over at [BibSonomy](https://www.bibsonomy.org/user/thoni/myown). For some of them, I published code on here.
